# Cube Point Clicker Add-on for Blender

Cube Point Clicker is a simple and fun clicker game for Blender. Create cube points, upgrade your clicker, and buy money generators to increase your money. The goal is to generate the most dense cube point cloud inside the 3D viewport.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of the add-on from the GitHub repository as a zip file.
2. Open Blender (Works with 3.5.0).
3. Go to `Edit` > `Preferences` > `Add-ons` > `Install`.
4. Locate and select the downloaded zip file, then click "Install Add-on."
5. Enable the add-on by checking the checkbox next to "Game: Cube Point Clicker."

## How to Play

1. Open Blender and make sure the Cube Point Clicker add-on is enabled.
2. In the 3D viewport, open the sidebar by pressing the `N` key or clicking the small arrow at the top-right corner.
3. Click the "Cube Point Clicker" tab in the sidebar.
4. To create cube points, click the "Make Cube Points" button. Each click generates cube points in the 3D viewport.
5. As you collect more cube points, you get money that can be spent to upgrade your clicker or buy money generators.
6. To upgrade your clicker, click the "Upgrade Clicker" button. This increases the number of points you get per click.
7. To buy money generators, click the "Buy Money Generator" button. This increases your passive income.
8. The money generator feature requires the Timeline to be running. Press `Shift + Space` to start the Timeline (this may vary depending on your keyboard shortcuts).

## Important Note

Make sure the Timeline is running (Shift + Space by default) for the money generator feature to work.
